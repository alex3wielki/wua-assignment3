          <h3>The Last Wish</h3>
          <p>The Last Wish is the first book of the Witcher Saga. It introduces us to Geralt, Dandelion, Yeneffer, Ciri, and many others. It explains how all this story began.</p>

            <h5>Aaron</h5>
            <p>Think about a fantasy book. Think about your favorite fantasy book. Chances are, it included elves or maybe dwarves. It probably had knights or something like them. It was, most likely, heavily influenced by Tolkien, or his successors, and
              it was probably based, at least in part, on a certain Anglo-saxon, or maybe French, sort of medieval culture. And if you read fantasy, there's probably 15 or so more like it on your bookshelf or your e-reader of choice.</p>
            <p>
              So here's my recommendation: put down Lord of the Rings. You've already read it. Put aside that new George R. R. Martin. It'll give him a chance to write a little further ahead, and you'll get a chance to read it again before the next one comes out. Set
              aside your Jordan, your Eddings or even your Pratchett. Do it, just for a little while. Just for the 2 days or so that it will take you to devour a series of short stories that have a totally different flavor. The stories of Geralt, the
              Witcher, professional monster hunter, sorcerer, swordsman and mutant. And you should do it for the same reason that you shouldn't have the exact same food at every meal. These short stories will leave you wanting so much more, and by the
              time you put it down, your last wish will be for the rest of the series to finally be translated from Polish to English so you can find out what happens next.</p>

          <h3>Sword of Destiny</h3>
          <p>The second book tells us a about the Golden Dragon, the underwater civilizaton, the begining of Catriona plague, and many more. It also shows us the actual meeting of Geralt and Ciri.</p>

            <p>WOW. Sapkowski, you f-ing rule.</p>
            <p>Everything about this book is awesome, from the characters to the world, to the humor and the fighting scenes. Geralt is a true badass, although he tries not to act like one. And his, kind of tragic, love story with Yennefer really gets to
              you. (unless you are a ghoul or something, and then Geralt will find you and destroy you.)</p>
            <p>So, if you haven't yet read any Andrzej Sapkowski, do it now. Yesterday if you could. You wont regret it.</p>

            <h5>Nerdsfather</h5>
            <p>Sometime in the 1990s, fantasy's center of gravity shifted. Simple heroism (and anti-heroism) were out, along with magical trinkets, gallant knights, noble savages, evil gods, prophesied chosen ones, elves, dwarves, dragons and most other
              mainstays of both the neo-Tolkeinic and sword and sorcery questing traditions. Moral ambiguity, violence, greed, vice, corruption and, above all, politics reigned in their stead.</p>
            <p>The gritty revolution was, and remains, a reaction to all the ridiculous tropes and cliches that once defined fantasy. Regardless of whether (and to what degree) gritty fantasy has grown captive to its own tropes, it was at one point inarguably
              fresh and inarguably revolutionary. The revolution did not, however, occur overnight. Glen Cook's The Black Company was published in 1984--a good dozen years before A Game of Thrones and fifteen before Gardens of the Moon. Rather, the transition
              occurred over the course the 1990s; as a result, most of that decade's major works straddle both worlds.</p>
            <p>Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher cycle is one of these hybrid beasts, and perhaps the most profound and significant of them all. On the face, you have an Elric clone questing through a Tolkeinic world populated by nearly every sentient non-human
              creature ever touched upon in fantasy (yes, there are even centaurs, werewolves and unicorns). He is trying to save the prophesied one from the evil, vaguely Teutonic/Russian Emperor to the South/East. He is handsome! He scores with hot
              chicks! He has a wisecracking sidekick! He kicks ass and everyone knows it!</p>
            <p>Only, if you peel off the bark of of this colorful and very traditional-seeming fantasy world, you discover the rot inside...</p>

            <h5>Jennifer</h5>
            <p>The symbolic Baptism of Fire is repeated throughout the story, as beliefs are challenged, paths reforged and it becomes certain that through the fire one must trek if he wishes to be born anew, like a phoenix rising from the ashes.</p>
            <p>There were so many delightful parts of this story, clever and witty moments that made me laugh out loud, as well as emotionally gripping instances that touched my heart in ways that will surely linger long after the entire story is finished.
            </p>
            <p>Now I move swiftly into The Tower of the Swallow, and with only two books left in the series I can already feel my heart growing heavy. These books have resonated with me in the most beautiful way, and will long be etched high atop the list
              of stories that touched my life and my heart. </p>
            <p>Sapkowski is a brilliant storyteller, and his wit is not lost in translation. He crafts rich characters, thrusts them into the darkest and most terrifying of situations and still manages to lighten the mood with a few laughs now and again.</p>
            <p>Five of five stars without hesitation, if you have not read these books I highly recommend them if you can find them. </p>

            <p>I did not read the official translation. I read a fan translation. Was still very good. The tone was not lost from the "official" translations of the previous books I read. Grammar and slang are great too. Do not hesitate to read the fan translations.
              They are free to download all over the place. Just make sure to purchase the official copy later so Sapkowski and his translation team do not get shafted.</p>
            <p>This is the darkest of the books in the series. Sapkowski adds a few new characters that you will love to hate. Ciri became one of my favorite characters in this book. It is a story of survival and sorrow for Ciri. Geralt and his band of misfits
              are back. They all grow as characters as well. Regis became one of my favorite characters of all time in this book. As always, Sapkowski's ability to set a scene and project a mood to readers is really exceptional.

            <h5>Ira Hollins</h5>
            <p>Based on how the books ended, and the two months and a half that took to finish the seven books, i was expecting to feel quite sad after finishing it.</p>
            <p>I'm not sure if it was because i still have the games for consolation or because the writer but, at the end, my negative expectation where completely vanished.</p>
            <p>The story didn't slowdown even at the end and although, in my opinion it was more bitter than sweeter, everything was nicely settled and fulfilling. Overhaul it's a great series with involving characters and setting, with a exquisite and interesting
              style (specially at the last book) that even fits with one of the main characters abilities.</p>
            <p>Great books, and hope to re-read the last tree books again with official English translations.</p>

    <h2>Short Overview</h2>
    <p>The Witcher Saga tells the story of Geralt of Rivia. A witcher, a monster hunter. Killing <em>vampires</em>, <em>werewolves</em>, <em>ghouls</em>, <em>basilisks</em>, and many other. He doesn't do it out of good heart. He does it for money. Witchers
      are an effect of magical experiments, they have no emotions, they are immune to diseases, they have a faster reflex, and heal in half the time humans do. The price for this is being sterile. They carry a silver medallion, which shows a wolf's head,
      and two swords. Silver and steel. People say the silver is for monsters, and steel is for humans. Witchers disagree. They say both swords are for <em>monsters</em></p>
    <p>Geralt had many adventures in his life. He had many woman, killed many people, and more monsters. He broke a spell, which changed a king's daughter into a vampire. For some reason, unlike other witchers, he was able to feel emotions, but they were
      distorted.
    </p>
    <p>Even though witchers save people's life, they are both hated and feared. This book is a <em>must-read</em> for any fantasy fan. The books are available in English. In the last years CD Project Red developed 3 video games, set in Witcher's universe.
      Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt, won over 800 awards.</p>
